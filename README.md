# 🌱 Smart Irrigation System (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## 📌 Overview
The **Smart Irrigation System** is an IoT-based project designed to **optimize water usage in agricultural fields**.  
It uses simulated devices in **Cisco Packet Tracer** to monitor soil and water conditions, and automatically controls irrigation when necessary.  
This ensures efficient water usage, reduces wastage, and helps farmers maintain healthy crops.

## ⚙️ System Architecture
- **Water Level Monitor** → Tracks water availability in the reservoir.  
- **Lawn Sprinklers (x3)** → Actuators that irrigate the field.  
- **Home Gateway (DLC100)** → Central IoT controller for automation.  
- **Tablet PC** → User interface for remote monitoring and control.  

---

## 🔁 Working
1. **Monitoring** – The system continuously tracks **water levels**.  
2. **Decision Making** – If soil (or water) level is below the threshold, the gateway decides irrigation is needed.  
3. **Actuation** – Sprinklers are turned ON/OFF automatically.  
4. **User Interface** – Farmers can monitor irrigation status and water availability via the tablet.

## 🎯 Features
- 🌍 **Water Conservation** – Prevents over-irrigation.  
- ⚡ **Automated Irrigation** – Based on soil/water data.  
- 📱 **Remote Monitoring** – Control via tablet.  
- 🔧 **Scalable** – Can add more IoT sensors (pH, humidity, temperature).  
- 🛰️ **IoT Simulation** – Implemented in Cisco Packet Tracer.

## 🌍 Benefits
- Efficient **water management** in agriculture.  
- Improved **crop health and yield**.  
- Reduces **manual labor** for farmers.  
- Helps combat **water scarcity challenges**.
